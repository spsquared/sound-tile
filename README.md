# Sound Tile
An app that lets you visualize music (or other sounds) in tiles.

Like [corrscope](https://github.com/corrscope/corrscope) but different.

Sound Tile runs in the browser (officially hosted at [soundtile.web.app](https://soundtile.web.app)), and features customizable spectrum analyzers (FFT) and waveform modes.

**STUFF**:
* Runs in real-time
* Multiple drawing styles for spectrum analyzers
* c o l o r s
* Realtime waveform correlation
* Basic text/image placement
* Also reactive images

Uses [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org) and [fflate](https://github.com/101arrowz/fflate).
